# Hurtigruten frontent assignment with Vue.js

This mini-project represents an approach to solve the Hurtigruten frontend assignment using Vue.js

## Framework

I have initialized this project using [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) and then copied in the express server from the original React-based assignment.

## Exercises

I have incrementally completed the assignments and have tagged each exercise along the way. The files currently in main include the completed code for Exercise 4 - Search as you type.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

## Running the code

The application has two scripts that are required to have running. Start each using `npm run server` (this starts the Express-server) and `npm run serve` (this starts the Vue application).
